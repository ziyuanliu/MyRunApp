##### Version 1
------
getpreference is used as the primary storage for persistence. Session keys such as IMG_LAST and IS_FROM_CAMERA
are used as session persistence, in case the activity gets destroyed on rotation. 

##### Version 2
------
This version includes all of the UI-shells for future implementation. We start by enabling the ActionBar which for now does
not contain any menu options, but does present the title. On the main activity, we have sliding tabs that present three panes.
The first is the start pane which will allow users to access the necessary options to start an exercise activity. History pane is
left blank for now. The Setting pane will allow users to set global app fields.
